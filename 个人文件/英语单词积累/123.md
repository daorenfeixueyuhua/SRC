Planing is good as it decides in detail how we do what we want to do.However, a plan can dear no fruit without being actually carried out.

My experience in the English speech context last October is a case in point. A month before  the  event. I spent hours working out a schedule outlining my goads and pracital steps. After that, I set out to read widely for an inspiring topic, wrote a speech and praciticed its delivey in beautiful pronunciation with good public speech skills. I finally came out of the contest as the first prize winner. I konw hwo U achived my success. It camse from good planing and better doing combined.
