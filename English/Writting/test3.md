# **Dose Happiness Lie in contentment?**

**An ancient Chinese proverb says "Happiness lies in contentment". which means that if a person is easy to be satisfied, then he will always be happy.**

**There are two kinds of opintions. On the one kind, some people support the statement above. They hold that the greatest treasure in life is happiness, while contentment is the indispensable key to cheerfulness and felicity. and the excessive material property is of no use at all. What they mention most frequently is this syaing "A contentment mind is a perpetual feast." On the othere hand, some people consider that contentment is nothing more than idlness and loss of ambition, and beging content is just an escape form reality. They belive that discontentment is  the first step to progress.**\

**In my view, poeple should never abandon the enterprising spirit to strive for their dreasm, as without discontentment, there will be no development of the society.**
