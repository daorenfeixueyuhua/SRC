**In this cartoon, a boy is talking with his mother about his teacher's reading assignment; whereas, he seems to hava some misconceptions about e-reading. From my perspective, e-reading is good but it cannot be simplified Facebook and text messages online.**

**For one thing, with the advent of the smart phone, e-reading has enjoyed increasing popularity among youg people in recent years. Despite the fact that e-reaing take up some much time we spend on tranditinoal reading, I don't think it's a bad thing considering that e-reaing offers us more changes to read at least. For anthoer, however, it should be carlified that e-reading means reading books or articles in electronic form, which cannot be confined to reading text message or browsing social networks such in Facebook. But I am regretful to find some youg people immersing themselves in social networks sometiems.**

**Therefor, int the era of the Internet, we must be well aware of what e-reading truly means and what is really worth our time and attention.**
